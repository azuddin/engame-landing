Founded on 8 Jan 2018, Engame doesn't have deep funds or a huge team to start, but we uphold a concept, which is to grow our studio to a place where creative game people from all around the world can gather, an international game. With this concept, we developed the Tap Master platform, and the game, Watafood, also our first Voucher Claiming Game has become the prototype of our future Play-to-Earn model.",

Years of hard work finally allowed us to achieve unprecedented success and honored to win the MDEC DiCE 2019 (Digital Content Creation Challenge 2019). Shortly after winning the MDEC DiCE 2019, we were contacted by Maxis, one of the major telecommunications corporations in Malaysia to participate in their upcoming Startup Challenge in November; we took it in a heartbeat and proceed to go through their submission and screening process; after a couple of weeks, they informed us with a piece of intriguing news, Endgame is chosen to be one of the top 100 startups in Malaysia by Maxis, we were also been given an opportunity to showcase our solution in their Maxis Market Access Day in December.",

With the development of the platform, we have also successfully received cooperation invitations from Texas and Tealive, everything is developing for the better, and the tacit understanding between the teams is becoming more and more mature. In December of the same year, we had another partner on our journey, we welcomed Ms. Jasmine officially joined Engame and enjoyed the game together.",
